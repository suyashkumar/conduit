[Conduit featured on Hackaday!](http://hackaday.com/2017/01/17/servo-controlled-iot-light-switches/)

Conduit is an entirely open-source web service that allows you to quickly and easily call functions on your [ESP8266 IoT devices](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Version-NodeMCU-Internet-Development/dp/B010O1G1ES/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1483953570&sr=8-3&keywords=nodemcu+esp8266) from anywhere in the world (even if those devices are behind private networks). 

You can do all this simply by dropping in a few lines of code into your firmware and then issuing RESTful API requests to the conduit web service to call your firmware functions. Skip ahead to a [full minimal example](README.md/#bink-an-led-from-the-cloud-full-example) if you're ready to get started right away!

## Conduit Components
* [Conduit backend web service (here)](https://github.com/suyashkumar/conduit)
* [Conduit firmware library](https://github.com/suyashkumar/conduit-firmware-library)
* [Conduit frontend](https://github.com/suyashkumar/conduit-frontend)

## Conduit API
A central conduit API server is already deployed at https://api.conduit.suyash.io (should be used for all API routes) with a user-friendly front-end deployed at https://conduit.suyash.io. 

| Method | Route          | Sample Request                                                                                                                           | Notes                                                                                                                     |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | /api/login     | ``` {   "email": "test@test.com",   "password": "test" }  ```                                                                            | Authenticate with Conduit, get issued a JWT                                                                               |
| POST   | /api/call      | ```{"token": "JWT token from login", "device_name": "myDeviceName", "function_name": "ledToggle", "wait_for_device_response": "true"}``` | Call a function (ledToggle) on one of your ESP8266 devices (named "myDeviceName" here)!                                   |
| POST   | /api/user_info | ```{"token": "JWT token from login"}```                                                                                                  | This returns information about your user account, including your account  secret which you must include in your firmware. |


## Sample Application using Conduit
[smart-lights](https://github.com/suyashkumar/smart-lights) is a sample project that uses v1 of this this library to switch lights from the cloud. It currently uses v1 of this library and should be updated to v2 shortly.

## Minimal Example
Below is a minimal example of firmware code needed to get started with Conduit to blink an LED. See the next section for a complete example. 
```C
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <Conduit.h> // get from suyashkumar/conduit-firmware-library or platformio

#define LED D0

const char* ssid = ""; // wifi ssid
const char* password = ""; // wifi password
const char* device_name = ""; // you pick this! IDentifier for your device
const char* server_url = "api.conduit.suyash.io"; // location of the API server
const char* account_secret = ""; // register and call /api/user_info to get this

Conduit conduit(device_name, server_url, account_secret);
int ledStatus = 0;

int ledToggle(RequestParams *rq){
  digitalWrite(LED, (ledStatus) ? HIGH : LOW); // LED is on when LOW
  ledStatus = (ledStatus) ? 0 : 1;
  Serial.println(rq->request_uuid);
  conduit.sendResponse(rq, (ledStatus) ? "ON":"OFF");
}

void setup(void){
  Serial.begin(115200); // Start serial
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);

  conduit.startWIFI(ssid, password); // Config/start wifi
  conduit.init();
  conduit.addHandler("ledToggle", &ledToggle);

}

void loop(void){
  conduit.handle();
}
```

and now you can call `ledToggle` on that device from anywhere in the world by using the following APIs:

### Call RESTful APIs to trigger ESP8266 Functions: 
1) Get your login token by authenticating
POST https://api.conduit.suyash.io/api/login:
   ```sh
   curl 'https://api.conduit.suyash.io/api/login' \
   -H 'content-type: application/json;charset=UTF-8'  \
   --data-binary '{"email":"YOUR_EMAIL", "password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}' --compressed
    ```

2) POST https://api.conduit.suyash.io/api/call:

   ```sh
   curl 'https://api.conduit.suyash.io/api/call' \
   -H 'content-type: application/json;charset=UTF-8'  \
   --data-binary '{"token":"YOUR_LOGIN_TOKEN","device_name":"YOUR_DEVICE_NAME","function_name":"ledToggle","wait_for_device_response":true}' --compressed
    ```


Conduit is currently in active development, so please feel free to contact me with comments/questions and submit pull requests!

## Bink an LED from the Cloud (full example).
Controlling an LED on the ESP8266 from the Cloud takes less than 5 minutes with Conduit. Example firmware code to go along with this tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/suyashkumar/conduit-firmware-library/tree/master/examples/basic_functionality) 

Please make sure you've installed the relevant drivers ([here](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx) if you're using the nodemcu ESP8266 chip linked above) and installed the [platformio](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html) build system (simply `brew install platformio` if you're on a mac).

1. Create a conduit account at https://conduit.suyash.io/#/login
2. Retreive your account secret from the Account view at https://conduit.suyash.io/#/account
3. Clone the conduit firmware repo and change into the `examples/basic_functionality` directory.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/suyashkumar/conduit-firmware-library.git
  cd examples/basic_functionality
  ```
4. Open `src/main.ino`. Fill in the following lines (account secret comes from step 2):

  ```C
const char* ssid = ""; // wifi ssid
const char* password = ""; // wifi password
const char* device_name = ""; // you pick this! IDentifier for your device
const char* server_url = "api.conduit.suyash.io"; // location of the API server
const char* account_secret = ""; // register and call /api/user_info to get this
  ```
5. Build the project using platformio. You should [install platformio](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/installation.html#python-package-manager) (if you haven't already) to build this properly. Ensure you're in the root directory of the example (not `src`) and run:

  ```sh
  platformio run
  ```
  If your ESP8266 chip is connected via usb already, to build and upload the program run:
  ```sh
  platformio run --target upload
  ```
  NOTE: to properly upload to an ESP8266 chip, you must have installed the [ESP8266 drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx) on your system already.

6. You should be set! You can now go to the conduit interact view (https://conduit.suyash.io/#/interact) and type in your device name (that you chose in step 4) and `ledToggle` as the function and hit "Execute!" to see your LED on your device toggle! You can also issue RESTful API requests to conduit to trigger functions on your device from any app that you build as mentioned [here](README.md#call-restful-apis-to-trigger-esp8266-functions)
